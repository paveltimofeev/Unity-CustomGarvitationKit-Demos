It's so beautiful day today, and I just sent new version of Custom Gravitational Kit to Asset Store reveiw. 
Really hope, in the next 5-10 business days it will be available for everybody.
But anyway, I think now I can share what it will include.

#### New Features
 - Added BaseCharacterController class - that can be used for implementing any own "gravity-affected" character controllers.
 - Control of fluctuation power from inspector's UI - any gravitational field can have small torque forces impacting on the objects, and now these forces could be tuned. 
 - ForceMode for gravitational fields. There was added 4 standart modes of gravity Force: Force, VelocityChange, Acceleration and Impulse. So, it can be confifured from UI now.

#### Some fixes
 - CentricGravity with BoxCollider was breaking SceneView, now it's fixed.
 - Fixed non-working invert mouse option of First Person Camera view.
 - Clean up and refactoring
